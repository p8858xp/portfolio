  <p>
    LA is home. No matter where I go or where I am, I am proud to say that LA is my motherland.
    LA is the place where I learned to be myself and be the person I am today.

  <h2>Golf</h2>
  <p>
    I was introduced to golf in LA and my life eventually came to revolve around it. I learned
    about the mentality to never give up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of all the competitions that I competed in for golf, I got to travel to many places with
    my dad. One of my favorite memories I have is when I went to San Diego with him because it didn't even
    feel like I was there for a tournament. Instead, it was as though we ran away from home for a short
    vacation. Golf was, is, and always will be a huge part of my life. I love the experiences golf provided
    and I will never forget the memories we shared together.
  </p>
  <h2>LA to NY</h2>
  <p>
    After 18 years of living only in LA, I decided to attend NYU and spend the next
    4 years of my life in NYC. I wanted to experience what it would be like to live
    in another state without my parents and I don't regret my decision at all. I came
    to appreciate my parents way more and be forever grateful for all things they have done
    for me back home. It's not easy to cook for yourself I unfortunately came to realize...
    NY has become my second home. I love its people, its community, and its rush.
  </p>
  <h2>RCF</h2>
  <p>
    New York City is the place that got me plugged into RCF. RCF or Remnant Christian
    Fellowship is a community I was lucky to come across and meet many brothers and sisters
    in Christ. I love being a part of this body and being able to serve alongside those
    who love God the same way that I do. Before I found RCF, I didn't really know who to hang
    out with and what I should do, but after being in RCF for a year now, the only word that
    I comes to mind is blessed. I can't wait for future plans God has planned for me next.
