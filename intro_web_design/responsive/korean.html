          <br />
          Having been raised in a Korean-cultured environment, I was exposed
          to many different kinds of korean food. As a result, I have grown
          to love korean food all together. The photo to the right is a korean dish
          known as bibimbap! It is pretty well-known to all Koreans and even many
          non-Koreans. I strangely didn't like bibimbap so much as a kid but I now
          absolutely love bibimbap. I recommend everyone who hasn't tried it to at least
          try it once.

          <br />
          This korean dish is known as naengmyeon! It's perfect to eat on a
          hot day and this dish really brings back a lot of memories for me. I used
          to hate this dish with a passion however as I've grown older, I also came
          to really find its sweet spot! It's known to be quite chewy because of
          its noodles which is why I believe it's necessary to cut the noodles before
          eating it.

          <br />
          Now who doesn't love a good korean bbq? It's not even
          a question of how amazing and delicious kbbq is. It definitely ranks
          at the top of my list of favorite foods because of its all-you-can-eat
          option at a fair price. My favorite type of meat to eat when I go for kbbq
          is the spicy pork with grilled onions on the side. I always tell my mom that I truly think that
          I can eat meat everyday if I had the opportunity!
