          <center><h2>Sashimi</h2>
          <br />
          Sashimi is so good. It's that simple. I love japanese food
          and I love sashimi. My favorite sashimi is the mackeral and
          the yellow tail. The only thing that's quite disappointing about
          sashimi is how pricy it can be, however it's worth it if you go eat
          it at the right places.

          <center><h2>Ramen</h2>
          <br />
            Everyone knows what ramen is. Ramen has been such a popular dish
            around the world however, japanese ramen is the best kind there is
            because there is no other broth like it. My favorite ramen place to go to
            is near the NYU campus called Ramenya! Not only is the broth delicious, but
            the noodles are perfect. As unhealthy as ramen is, I don't think I could ever
            give it up because it holds such a special place in my heart.

          <center><h2>Sushi</h2>
          <br />
          Finally, my other favorite Japanese dish is sushi. There are so
          many different kinds of rolls with different unimaginable tastes.
          The image to the right is a photo of the well-known california tuna
          roll. Whenever I go to eat sushi, I like to get a variety of different
          rolls rather than getting many of the same kind. I really love the rolls
          that have eel in them. Most of all, if I were to recommend one roll that is a must-try,
          it would have to be the dragon roll just because it's a classic.
