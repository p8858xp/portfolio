      I was born in Los Angeles, California and lived there for
      most of my life, however, I am currently living in NYC as a student at <a href=
      "http://www.nyu.edu" target="_blank">NYU</a> One of my favorite mottos that I love to remind myself is "Never,
      never, never give up" by Winston Churchill. For being 20 years old, I can say
      I've gone through many experiences; experiences that I find to be the core of
      my life. <a href = "info.html">Click here to find out more about my experiences</a>

      I also have many interests and hobbies that I love to do in my free time.I love
      to play pick-up basketball, I love eating food, and so much more!
